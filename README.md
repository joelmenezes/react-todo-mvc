# React To-Do app

A simple To-Do application that utilizes the React framework to create a beautiful To-Do web app.

## Setup

Clone the repository using the following command.

```
git clone --recursive git@gitlab.com:joelmenezes/React-ToDo-MVC.git
```

## Running

The app is built with [JSX](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) and compiled at runtime for a lighter and more fun code reading experience. As stated in the link, JSX is not mandatory.

To run the app, spin up an HTTP server (e.g. `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`) and visit http://localhost/.../myexample/.
